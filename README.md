## Overview

This project's focus was directed towards offering Empire Home Remodeling (EHR) insight into King County, Washington's housing market in terms of the most beneficial addition for remodeling homes. The project observed one table of housing information containing a total collection of 21,597 houses and 21 columns, these columns were then consolidated to two separate models based on the house locations within King County [rural and urban]. The model for urban King County focused on relating price to house square footage, grade (quality rating), waterfront (view of the water), and whether each house had a basement or not. The model for rural focused on relating price to house square footage, grade, whether each house had a basement or not. This analysis can be useful to provide Empire Home Remodeling with renovation proposals that would yield the most profitable returns.

## Business Problem

EHR may benefit from directing their funding, in urban King County, towards adding a basement, increasing house square footage, increasing grade, and obtain waterfront view if the view was previously obstructed. In rural King County, EHR may benefit from increasing house square footage, and improving grade.

---

## Data

The given table contained housing information which included the square footage of the property and home, latitude and longitude, waterfront view, basement or no basement, and other various other house attributes as number of floors and grade. 

---

## Methods

This project uses inferential analyses to identify the relationship between the data's variables (house information) and price. The inferential analyses used was the ordinary least squares linear regression model.

## Results

Visual of the districts sepparating rural from urban King County, Washington in our model

---

The urban squarefoot graph displays a comparison with price. This indicates a linear relationship, meaning that they are positively correlated to one another.

In the urban grade graph, the houses were separated by their grade. The average price the houses sold were then plotted according to their grade.

This graph was separated into 10 groups of houses according to their overall square footage. We then took those 10 groups and determined which houses had waterfront property and which did not. Once that was determined we graphed the mean price of the houses in each group and compared the homes that did have waterfront property to the houses that did not have waterfront property.

The rural squarefootage graph displays a comparison with price. This indicates a linear relationship, meaning that they are positively correlated to one another.

---

Rural grade also has a linear relationship with price indicating that the price increases as a result of an increase in the grade of the house.

## Conclusions

The project's analysis recommends a variety of potential home additions to increase the overall profitability of EHR's house renovations. 

---

For Urban King County:

* adding a basement

* increasing house square footage

* improving grade

* obtaining waterfront view if view was previously obstructed 

---

For Rural King County:

* increasing house square footage

* improving grade


---

## Next Steps

Further analysis could offer more in-depth predictions to:

* Further explore the ratio of bathrooms to bedrooms and their relationship to price  

* Inpect the interactions between the independent variables and the target variables(ex: how increasing square footage effects price given that it is a waterfront home and vice versa).
